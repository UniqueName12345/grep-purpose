## v0.6.13-alpha~regret@caffeine  
### #13 - Add NPC money and new places  
NPCs now live in a hell-economy. Money is tracked. Places exist. Both are probably meaningless.

## v0.6.12-alpha~confusion@fridaynight  
### #12 - Add settings to switch APIs  
Now you can choose your favorite hallucination engine. Great for variety, terrible for stability.

## v0.6.11-alpha~onfire@panic  
### #11 - Add INTERNALS docs and update README  
Finally documented the chaos. Still no map for the emotional terrain.

## v0.6.10-alpha~shrug@devbox  
### #10 - Add Pollinations GET option  
Switched to a text API held together with duct tape and query strings. It works. Ish.

## v0.6.9-alpha~numb@coffee  
### #9 - Enable collisions and chat completions  
Your NPCs can now bump into each other mid-sentence. Just like real life.

## v0.6.7-alpha~despair@breakdown  
### #7 - Enable starvation death and persona-based chat  
Hunger is real. Personality is optional. Death is permanent.

## v0.6.6-alpha~unhinged@thursdaynight  
### #6 - Add permadeath collisions and fancy IO  
If it crashes into you, it may kill you. But at least the output looks better now.

## v0.6.5-alpha~hopeful@init  
### #5 - Add simple simulation systems and input-driven TUI  
Finally: a terminal UI and a simulation core. NPCs do things. Some of them even make sense.

Stay tuned for `v0.7.0-meltdown~crisis@2AM`, where we might add relationships and bathroom accidents.
